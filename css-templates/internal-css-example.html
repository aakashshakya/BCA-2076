    <h1>This is an example of Internal CSS</h1>
    <h1>This is second line.</h1>
    <h1 style="color: black;">We can see the power of inline css here.</h1>
    <p>
 Usually the style sheets are written inside the head tag.
 They are used in conditions where we want to use a style in complete body.
 The style which are to be used commonly are defined by using selector such has HTML tag or class identifier or id identifier.
 The main disadvantage of using internal css is that the style can be used in that particular file only.
